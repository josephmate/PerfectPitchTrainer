            Clicking "Play Note", will play a note and you will need to guess which note was played.
            No statistics will be recorded.
            You can play on the digital piano and guitar at the bottom to help you guess the note.

            You are currently testing with notes: <div id="testNotes"></div>.
            We we add another note once you attempt at least 10, and get over 90% accuracy that day.
            The score resets everyday, but your computer will save it so you can track your progress.

                We start you off easy.
                We will play one of two notes that can come from any octave.
                Once you reach 90% accuracy, well add in the next note.
                We'll do this until all notes have been added!
