            You are currently in "Free Practice".
            Clicking "Play Note", will play a note and you will need to guess which note was played.
            No statistics will be recorded.
            You can play on the digital piano and guitar at the bottom to help you guess the note.

                We will add another note once you attempt at least 10, and get over 90% accuracy that day.
                The score resets everyday, but your computer will save it so you can track your progress.

            In this mode, you cannot use the digital keyboard at the bottom for help.
            Statistics will be saved to your computer.
            We'll group the statistics by day so you can track your progress.
            <p>
                We start you off easy.
                We will play one of two notes that can come from any octave.
                Once you reach 90% accuracy, well add in the next note.
                We'
                ll do this until all notes have been added!

            <button onclick="removeANote()">Remove a note</button>
            <p>
                If you disagree with 90%, we give you the option of adding a removing notes to control your own progression.
                However, we recommended you get 90% with the current notes before adding another note, otherwise your ear will have to work harder.
